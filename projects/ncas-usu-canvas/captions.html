<h2>Why Quality Captions Matter</h2>
<p>Captions are essential for many students who are deaf or hard of hearing to comprehend audible content in videos. They also aid in language learning and content comprehension, especially in noisy environments or when audio can't be accessed. To be effective, captions must be accurate, well-timed, and use correct grammar and punctuation.</p>

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>
<section class="heading-section">
<h3>Find and Select</h3>
<section class="heading-section">
<h4>Find and Select Captioned Videos</h4>
<p>When selecting videos for instruction, choose videos that already include high quality captions. Look for the CC button in the video player to confirm captions are available. Some platforms let you filter search results to show only captioned videos. For example, when searching for a video on YouTube, you can choose to search only for captioned videos:</p>
<p><img id="1189512" class="img-responsive-600 centered" src="https://usucourses.instructure.com/courses/2803/files/1197425/preview" alt="A screenshot of the YouTube search bar filter. A large red arrow points to the option Subtitles/CC under Features in the filter section." width="100%" height="100%" data-api-endpoint="https://usucourses.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2803/files/1197425" data-api-returntype="File" /></p>
<p>Selecting this filter will only return videos with human created captions and exclude videos with machine captions or no captions.</p>
</section>
<section class="heading-section">
<h4>Use Closed Captions</h4>
<p>When possible, choose videos with closed captions that students can turn on or off as needed. This gives students control over how they experience the content. Try using the CC button to turn the captions on and off in this video:</p>
<div class="ytplayer centered"><iframe style="width: 401px; height: 225px;" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VgrgMYjq2lI?si=bd2egHdnog6q3jbD" width="401" height="225" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe></div>
<p>Open captions, by contrast, are always visible and cannot be customized or turned off by the student.</p>
<div class="ytplayer centered"><iframe style="width: 402px; height: 226px;" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CoZAc1O8c6c?si=QvBlGc3JbQK3TU2q" width="402" height="226" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe></div>

<h3>Create and Edit</h3>
<section class="heading-section">
<h4>Accurately Reflect Spoken Dialogue</h4>
<p>Accurate captions must reflect the video's spoken dialogue word for word. Summarizing or skipping content can cause confusion and leave out important information for viewers who rely on captions.</p>
</section>
<section class="heading-section">
<h4>Go Beyond Dialogue</h4>
<section class="heading-section">
<h5>Offscreen Speaker Identification</h5>
<p>Students using captions can often see who is speaking. However, when the speaker is offscreen or can't be easily identified, it is important to add that information to the captions. Notice how the caption identifies the unseen speaker, making it easier for students to follow the conversation in these examples:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 80px;">
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Offscreen Spoken Dialogue:</strong> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">"Come in!"</span></p>
<p><strong>Caption:</strong> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">[Mr. Lee, offscreen]: Come in!</span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</section>
<section class="heading-section">
<h5>Sound Effects</h5>
<p>Videos often include sound effects alongside speaker dialog. When a sound effect is meaningful to understanding the scene, it should be added to the captions. In these examples, the described sound provides key context that helps students follow the action:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 80px;">
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Audio Only:</strong> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">A loud crash is heard as a stack of books falls.</span></p>
<p><strong>Caption:</strong> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">[books crashing to the floor]</span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</section>
<section class="heading-section">
<h5>Background Music</h5>
<p>Another common type of background sound is music, which can give students important clues about the mood or meaning of a scene. When background music is significant, it should be reflected in the captions. In the examples that follow, note how captioning the emotional quality of the music helps the audience better understand the tone of the scene:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 80px;">
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Audio Only:</strong> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Sad, slow piano music plays during a reflective scene.</span></p>
<p><strong>Caption:</strong> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">[somber piano music playing]</span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</section>
</section>
<section class="heading-section">
<h4>Break Captions at Natural Pauses</h4>
<p>Divide lines of text at natural pauses or punctuation points. This improves readability and allows students and other viewers to process information more smoothly.</p>
<p><strong>Sample caption text:</strong></p>
<div style="padding-left: 80px;">
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">"Today, we're starting a new topic: fractions. Fractions are a way to show parts of a whole. You see them in everyday life, like slicing a pizza or measuring ingredients. Let's explore how they work and why they matter."</span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Bad example of line breaks:</strong></p>
<p><em>Caption 1:</em><br />Today, we're starting a new topic: fractions. Fractions</p>
<p><em>Caption 2:</em><br />are a way to show parts of a whole. You see them in</p>
<p><em>Caption 3:</em><br />everyday life, like slicing a pizza or measuring</p>
<p><em>Caption 4:</em><br />ingredients. Let's explore how they work and why</p>
<p><em>Caption 5:</em><br />they matter.</p>
<p><strong>Good example of line breaks:</strong></p>
<p><em>Caption 1:</em><br />Today, we're starting a new topic: fractions.</p>
<p><em>Caption 2:</em><br />Fractions are a way to show parts of a whole.</p>
<p><em>Caption 3:</em><br />You see them in everyday life,<br />like slicing a pizza or measuring ingredients.</p>
<p><em>Caption 4:</em><br />Let's explore how they work and why they matter.</p>

<h3>Review and Edit Automatic Captions</h3>
<p>Auto-generated captions often contain errors, such as misspelled words, incorrect punctuation, or misheard phrases that can confuse or mislead students and other viewers. Always take time to review and edit them so they are accurate, complete, and properly timed to the video.</p>

<h2>Quality Captions Applied: Creating a Welcome Video</h2>
<p>Mrs. Okediji plans to record a video welcoming her high school senior students to her literature class. She will record the video on her phone and put it on the school learning management system (LMS) for students to view before their first class.</p>
<p>Mrs. Okediji doesn't plan to write a full script for the video, but she does have a few notes to be sure that she introduces herself and discusses her expectations for her students. She records a seven-minute video and uploads it to YouTube, which automatically drafts a caption file. Because there are errors in the automatic captions, Mrs. Okediji takes 10-15 minutes to correct the mistakes in YouTube. Lastly, she shares the captioned video in her LMS for her students to view.</p>
<p>For Kelsea, who has auditory processing disorder, video captions are an effective way for her to understand spoken words in videos. She relies on closed captioning when she streams her favorite shows and content. When she plays Mrs. Okediji's welcome video, she clicks on the "CC" button to display the captions. Now, Kelsea can start class with the same information about the instructor and the class as her peers.</p>
