<h2>Why Accessible Tables Matter</h2>
<p>Accessible tables ensure that students with and without disabilities can access information in equivalent ways. Formatting the table to be accessible helps students visually track and comprehend row and column data. It also ensures that a screen reader will announce table headers as students navigate the table with a keyboard, making it easier to interpret the data and follow the table's structure.</p>

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>
<section class="heading-section">
<h3>Use Clear Column and Row Headers</h3>
<p>Headers act like labels for your table's data, helping all students, especially those using assistive technologies like screen readers, understand what each row and column represents. Always define headers in your table formatting tools to ensure that screen readers read the table content correctly.</p>
<p>Press play, then close your eyes and listen as a reader user describes their experience navigating a table formatted with proper row and column headers.</p>

</section>
<section class="heading-section">
<h3>Keep Table Structures Simple</h3>
<p>Avoid merged cells and mixing headers with data cells. A straightforward table layout helps students using assistive technology interpret data correctly and allows students to visually follow information more easily.</p>
</section>
<section class="heading-section">
<h3>Avoid Using Images of Tables</h3>
<p>Never use screenshots or pictures of tables. They are not readable by screen readers and can't be adjusted for accessibility. Instead, create tables using your content editor tools. For example, the tables on this page were built using the table tool in Canvas highlighted in the screenshot below. Once the table is inserted, Canvas's Accessibility Checker below the text editor box will prompt you to label the headers to improve accessibility.</p>

</section>
<section class="heading-section">
<h3>Add a Descriptive Caption When Needed</h3>
<p>When the purpose of the table isn't obvious from the context, include a caption or a short description outside the table. This helps all students understand what the table is showing, especially those with cognitive or visual disabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Example: When a Caption Adds Meaning to Table Data</strong></p>
<table class="table-standard-height" border="1"><caption>Table 1: Monthly Rainfall (in inches) Recorded in Three U.S. Cities During Spring 2024</caption>
<thead>
<tr class="table-header-row">
<th class="table-header-cell" scope="col"><span class="table-font-large">Month</span></th>
<th class="table-header-cell" scope="col"><span class="table-font-standard">Seattle</span></th>
<th class="table-header-cell" scope="col"><span class="table-font-standard">Chicago</span></th>
<th class="table-header-cell" scope="col"><span class="table-font-standard">Miami</span></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="table-row-alt-1">
<th class="table-body-cell" scope="row">March</th>
<td class="table-body-cell">5.2</td>
<td class="table-body-cell">3.4</td>
<td class="table-body-cell">2.9</td>
</tr>
<tr class="table-row-alt-2">
<th class="table-body-cell" scope="row">April</th>
<td class="table-body-cell">3.9</td>
<td class="table-body-cell">3.8</td>
<td class="table-body-cell">3.2</td>

<tr class="table-row-alt-1">
<th class="table-body-cell" scope="row">May</th>
<td class="table-body-cell">2.7</td>
<td class="table-body-cell">4.5</td>
<td class="table-body-cell">5.1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If the content editor that you are using does not support table captions, a heading is a good alternative.</p>
</section>
<section class="heading-section">
<h3>Use Tables to Organize Information, Not for Content Layout</h3>
<p>Tables should organize data, not control where content appears on the page. Using tables for layout can confuse screen reader users and create barriers for students navigating with other assistive technology. Layout tables can also make it harder for students who zoom in or use mobile devices, as they may cause content to extend off-screen and require horizontal scrolling.</p>
</section>
<section class="heading-section">
<h3>Use Visual Cues to Support Comprehension</h3>
<p>Apply visual formatting, like bold text for headers or alternating row colors, to help students quickly scan and interpret the table. These visual cues enhance clarity for all students, especially those with learning or visual processing disabilities, but should always be used in addition to (not instead of) proper table header structure.</p>
<p>Table 1 shows how simple formatting can make a table easier to read and more visually accessible.</p>

<h2>Accessible Tables Applied: Creating a Class Schedule</h2>
<p>Mr. Hernandez wants his students to know when each of his 7th grade chemistry class units will be covered during the semester, including the topics and exam schedule for each one. The class is taught in four units with two exams per unit.</p>
<p>Mr. Hernandez creates a table in Microsoft Word. He makes "Topic" the header for the first column, "Unit" the header for the second, then "Exam 1" and "Exam 2" for the third and fourth columns. He puts the topics, unit numbers, and exam schedule in the appropriate columns. The topics are also headers for data in each row.</p>
<table class="table-standard" border="1"><caption></caption>
<thead>
<tr class="table-header-row">
<th class="table-header-cell" scope="col"><span class="table-font-standard">Topic</span></th>
<th class="table-header-cell" scope="col"><span class="table-font-standard">Unit</span></th>
<th class="table-header-cell" scope="col"><span class="table-font-standard">Exam 1</span></th>
<th class="table-header-cell" scope="col"><span class="table-font-standard">Exam 2</span></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="table-row-alt-1">
<th class="table-body-cell" scope="row">States of Matter</th>
<td class="table-body-cell">1</td>
<td class="table-body-cell">Week 2</td>
<td class="table-body-cell">Week 4</td>
</tr>
<tr class="table-row-alt-2">
<th class="table-body-cell" scope="row">Atoms and Molecules</th>
<td class="table-body-cell">2</td>
<td class="table-body-cell">Week 6</td>
<td class="table-body-cell">Week 8</td>
</tr>
<tr class="table-row-alt-1">
<th class="table-body-cell" scope="row">Chemical Reactions</th>
<td class="table-body-cell">3</td>
<td class="table-body-cell">Week 10</td>
<td class="table-body-cell">Week 12</td>
</tr>
<tr class="table-row-alt-2">
<th class="table-body-cell" scope="row">The Periodic Table</th>
<td class="table-body-cell">4</td>
<td class="table-body-cell">Week 14</td>
<td class="table-body-cell">Week 17</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Mr. Hernandez makes sure that the table is accessible by checking that the "Header Row" and "First Column" options are selected in the Table Design ribbon in Word.</p>
<p><img id="1189522" class="img-responsive-650 centered" src="https://usucourses.instructure.com/courses/2803/files/1197426/preview?verifier=LXroAvMHkU6WTZ7dRXcw2fDGTfXEyWgQR6NUoXcv" alt="Screenshot showing the Header Row and First Column options checked in Word’s Table Design tools." width="100%" height="100%" data-api-endpoint="https://usucourses.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2803/files/1197426" data-api-returntype="File" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Since Mr. Hernandez made the table accessible, Felix will hear changes in row or column headers as he navigates the table while using his screen reader. For example, when Felix moves between the cells that read "Week 2" and "Week 4" his screen reader will announce the column header for "Week 4": "Exam 2." The alternating row colors and bold column and row headers also make it easier for Mr. Hernandez's students to visually track and make sense of the information.</p>
