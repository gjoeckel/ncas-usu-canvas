<p class="margin-top-50">Links (also referred to as hypertext or hyperlinks) are interactive elements in webpages or digital documents that connect students to other pages or resources. They increase interactivity and expand students’ access to related materials and information on a topic.</p>

<h2>Why Accessible Links Matter</h2>
<p>Accessible links benefit all students by making navigation clear and efficient. They are descriptive and explain where the link leads, and are visually formatted to make them easy to spot on the page. This helps students who scan the content visually, use voice control to activate links, rely on screen readers, or listen to text-to-speech quickly identify links and understand their purpose. When links are poorly designed, students may become confused, frustrated, or even miss important instructions or entire assignments.</p>

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>
<section class="heading-section">
<h3>Use Clear, Descriptive Link Text</h3>
<p>Links should make sense on their own. Steer clear of generic phrases like “click here,” “link to,” or “read more,” which don’t tell students where the link will take them out of context. Instead, write link text that clearly describes the link's purpose or destination to help students know what to expect. Review these four examples:</p>
<ol class="list-decimal">
<li>Bad link text: <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://example.com/" target="_blank">Click here</a> to explore resources on Native American History.</li>
<li>Clear link text: Explore <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://example.com/" target="_blank">Native American History Resources</a>.</li>
<li>Bad link text: <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://example.com/" target="_blank">Link to video</a>.</li>
<li>Good link text: <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://example.com/" target="_blank">Watch the video on Photosynthesis Basics</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Links Applied: Guiding Students to Additional Materials</h2>
<p>Ms. Jarvis teaches 6th grade English Language Arts and posts her assignments in the school’s learning management system. As she creates an assignment asking students to compare a poem in its written form to a multimedia version, she recognizes the need to include two links, one to each version of the poem.</p>
<p>Instead of pasting in long, unclear URLs to each resource, Ms. Jarvis prioritizes accessibility and inserts two brief but descriptive links. She remembers not to use vague link text like “click here,” since it doesn’t help students distinguish between the two resources, especially out of context. Her assignment begins:</p>
<blockquote>Please re-read <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken" target="_blank">Robert Frost’s poem “The Road Not Taken”</a>, and watch the <a class="youtube-link inline_disabled" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGB_K_xlHdI" target="_blank">animated version of the poem on YouTube</a>.</blockquote>
<p>After adding the remaining instructions, Ms. Jarvis tests the links to make sure they work. Because the link text is descriptive and visually identifiable, all students can easily find the right resources to complete the assignment. This includes Quinn, a student with dyslexia, who uses a text reader to highlight the words in his assignments as they are read out loud. Since the links are easy to find and make sense in the instructions, they don’t disrupt the flow of the text reader, and he can quickly locate and use them.</p>
