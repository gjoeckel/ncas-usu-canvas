<p class="margin-top-50">Headings are used to organize chunks of information into sections and subsections. When text is formatted like a heading, it acts like a signpost, visually guiding a student through a page or document. When text is identified as a heading in a semantic structure, a student using screen reading software is able to use it to navigate to that section of the content.</p>
<p>Heading levels should be used consistently:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heading 1</strong> is used for the main topic and is typically limited to one per webpage or document.</li>
<li><strong>Heading 2</strong> is used to describe sections within the main topic.</li>
<li><strong>Heading 3 and beyond</strong> are used for subsections within each section.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Headings Matter</h2>
<p>Headings are essential for helping students move through content efficiently. Sighted learners can scan through the document and look for headings and blind students can quickly navigate to different parts of a page using their screen reader. Some programs, like Word and Google Docs, have a sidebar that allows learners to quickly scan and navigate the document using its headings.</p>

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>
<section class="heading-section">
<h3>Use Headings to Describe Sections of Content</h3>
<p>A heading describes the content that comes after it. Most content editors have options to format text as different levels of headings (instead of the default/normal/paragraph style), and it is important to use these options when creating headings. It is not enough to just change the text size, font, or style.</p>
<p>The inverse of this is also true—don't use headings just to change the look of a block of text. Make sure a heading "heads up" the content that follows.</p>
<p>Consider the example of a resource on rainforests that starts with the text "The Wonders of the Rainforest," followed by "Discover the rich biodiversity and hidden secrets of one of Earth's most vital ecosystems."</p>
<p><img id="1189487" class="img-responsive-550 centered" src="https://usucourses.instructure.com/courses/2803/files/1197422/preview?verifier=zxyK59OreJMLYq5SH4WTlrvqykUzpqwqIto1zdTg" alt="Screenshot showing the visual styling of the heading and supporting tagline sentence." width="100%" height="100%" data-api-endpoint="https://usucourses.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2803/files/1197422" data-api-returntype="File" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>"The Wonders of the Rainforest" is the main topic and should be formatted using Heading 1. "Discover the rich biodiversity..." adds context to the main heading, but it doesn't function as a heading. Even though it is a different color and size than the body text, it should be formatted as a paragraph or normal text.</p>
</section>
<section class="heading-section">
<h3>Use Heading Levels Correctly</h3>
<p>The order of heading levels should be logical. Most documents should start with a single Heading 1 that describes the document's purpose. Heading 2 should be used to briefly describe each major section in the document, heading 3 for subsections, and so on. Avoid skipping headings—like jumping from a heading 1 to a heading 3.</p>
<p>To understand why headings shouldn’t be skipped, picture an assignment on the solar system with 4 main sections—Introduction, Inner Planets, Outer Planets, and Conclusion. The assignment starts with a Heading 1: The Solar System, followed by a Heading 2: Introduction. Looking good so far. But the next two sections—“Inner Planets” and “Outer Planets”— are both structured as Heading 3 and the planets within each section are Heading 4. This makes it seem like these areas are subsections of the Introduction and not main sections in the document. This is confusing for screen reader users navigating the document using headings. It also creates a confusing outline structure presented in the sidebar, as shown here in Word:</p>
<p><img id="1189488" class="screen img-responsive-250 centered" src="https://usucourses.instructure.com/courses/2803/files/1197423/preview?verifier=7bTTG3j0zLrBQZlI54rM3G8KpnwEebL5ZyRca0hy" alt="Screenshot showing confusing heading structure in Word sidebar." width="100%" height="100%" data-api-endpoint="https://usucourses.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2803/files/1197423" data-api-returntype="File" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>To fix this, “Inner Planets” and “Outer Planets” should be changed to Heading 2s, and all of the planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, etc. — should be changed to Heading 3s. This makes "Introduction," "Inner Planets," and "Outer Planets" main sections of the document:</p>
<p><img id="1189489" class="screen img-responsive-250 centered" src="https://usucourses.instructure.com/courses/2803/files/1197424/preview?verifier=T1zfaS78wbU5OMSlagVwG8fogky33yFc0nwg2Ljm" alt="Screenshot showing confusing heading structure in Word sidebar." width="100%" height="100%" data-api-endpoint="https://usucourses.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2803/files/1197424" data-api-returntype="File" loading="lazy"></p>

<h3>Avoid Empty Headings</h3>
<p>An empty heading is never helpful. It will make the document harder to navigate and understand. Screen reader users often navigate a document by headings, and it can be confusing to navigate to a heading only to have nothing read.</p>
<p>To add white space correctly, use formatting tools like paragraph spacing, line breaks, or padding in your content editor. This maintains a clean layout without disrupting accessibility or content structure.</p>
<p>For example, a teacher is creating a lesson in Microsoft Word about steam locomotives. If he were to create empty space around an image by adding a Heading 2 before and after the image, this would impact the structure of the document:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img id="1197526" class="img-responsive-500 centered" src="https://usucourses.instructure.com/courses/2803/files/1197526/preview?verifier=CBMOptqgW5ZxoEEsA0Qa63C6fQdHuAi7UXRMwPBF" alt="Screenshot of &quot;Heading 2&quot; selected on the Styles dialog box, with a red barred circle overlay." width="500" height="252" data-api-endpoint="https://usucourses.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2803/files/1197526" data-api-returntype="File" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Instead, he increases the line spacing before and after the image using paragraph formatting.</p>

<h2>Headings Applied: Organizing a Study Guide</h2>
<p>Ms. Patel, a 5th grade teacher, is preparing a study guide on the water cycle. She wants to ensure her document is well-organized and accessible to all her students.</p>
<p>Ms. Patel opens Google Docs and starts a new document. She types the name of her lesson plan: "The Water Cycle"<strong> </strong>and selects Heading 1 for this text.</p>
<p>Ms. Patel creates sections for each part of the water cycle. She types "Introduction" and selects Heading 2. She continues this process for other sections: "Evaporation," "Condensation," "Precipitation," and "Collection," each time using Heading 2.</p>
<p>Under "Evaporation," she wants to explain the process in detail. She types "Definition" and selects Heading 3. She adds another subsection, "Examples," and selects Heading 3 for it as well.</p>
<p>Ms. Patel reviews her document using the “tabs &amp; outlines” sidebar to make sure that each section and subsection has the correct headings and that she hasn't skipped any heading levels.<br><img id="1197529" class="screen img-responsive-300 centered" src="https://usucourses.instructure.com/courses/2803/files/1197529/preview?verifier=1OX6M9M7OxHsczKea45IlsRJuy4Nnsa4RnwaA9C8" alt="Screenshot" width="300" height="432" data-api-endpoint="https://usucourses.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2803/files/1197529" data-api-returntype="File" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>During a class discussion of the water cycle, all students benefit from Ms. Patel's well-organized document, including Jamie, a blind student. Jamie uses a Bluetooth earbud to listen to her screen reader with one ear and the classroom conversation with the other. Because the study guide has a clear heading structure, Jamie can quickly navigate through specific sections of the document and participate with the rest of the class.</p>
