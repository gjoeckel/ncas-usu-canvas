<h2>Why Clear Writing Matters</h2>
<p>Writing clearly helps students understand information more easily. When language is simple and well-organized, students can focus on the meaning without getting stuck on complicated words or confusing sentences. Clear writing can be especially helpful for students with learning and cognitive disabilities and students who use assistive technology.</p>

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>
<section class="heading-section">
<h3>Keep Sentences Short and Focused</h3>
<p>Use simple sentences that share one idea at a time to help students understand.</p>
</section>
<section class="heading-section">
<h3>Use Familiar Words</h3>
<p>Choose everyday words that your students already know. Avoid complex or technical words that may cause confusion unless they are an important part of the instruction.</p>
</section>
<section class="heading-section">
<h3>Organize Content with Headings and Lists</h3>
<p>Break up content to make it more readable using descriptive headings. Use lists to summarize and break down complex information.</p>
</section>
<section class="heading-section">
<h3>Explain New Terms</h3>

</section>
<section class="heading-section">
<h3>Break Up Long Paragraphs</h3>

<h2>Clear Writing Applied: Writing Clear Instructions</h2>
<p>Ms. Brazzle, an 8th grade science teacher, is preparing instructions for an upcoming group project on the solar system. Remembering that many students struggled with the assignment last time, she wants to revise the instructions to make them clearer and avoid confusion.</p>
<p>As she gets started, she thinks about Meadow, a student in her course who has a learning disability who often misses steps in assignments. Her goal is to write the instructions clearly enough for Meadow to follow, with the hope that all of her students will benefit.</p>
<p>She begins by reading the instructions aloud to herself and notices several ways they can be improved. She breaks the long paragraph of instructions into short introductory sentences followed by a list of step-by-step directions. She also adds definitions to help students understand the terms &lsquo;orbit&rsquo; and &lsquo;celestial&rsquo;, which she introduces as part of the assignment.</p>
<p>When she finishes, she uploads the new version of the assignment to Google Classroom and is delighted to find that the project goes much better for everyone. Now Meadow can complete her part of the group assignment without missing any instructions!</p>
