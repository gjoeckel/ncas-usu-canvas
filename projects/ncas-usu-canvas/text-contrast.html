<p class="margin-top-50">Color contrast is the visual brightness difference between two colors. The contrast between a text color and its background color is measured as a ratio, which ranges from 1:1 (e.g., white on white) to 21:1 (e.g., black on white). To meet minimum contrast requirements, most text needs a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1. If text is at least 18pt, or 14pt and bold, this requirement drops to 3:1.</p>

<h2>Why Text Contrast Matters</h2>
<p>Good contrast makes text easier to see and read in any situation, but there are some situations where it can be especially helpful. This could be a temporary situation like reading a page outdoors on a sunny day or a permanent condition related to age, vision loss, or other disability.</p>

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>
<section class="heading-section">
<h3>Choose Colors with Good Contrast</h3>
<p>When choosing text colors, make sure that they have good contrast. Remember that the minimum requirement for contrast is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>4.5:1</strong> for most text.</li>
<li><strong>3:1</strong> for large text.
<ul>
<li>For tools that use points (like Google Docs or Word), that's &ge;18pt or &ge;14 pt + bold</li>
<li>For tools that use pixels, that's &ge;24px, or &ge;18.67px + bold.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you ever wonder if a color combination has enough contrast, use a contrast checking tool to find the text's contrast ratio. Some tools, like Microsoft Word, have built in contrast checkers that will consider the text size when testing contrast. For example, pure red (#FF0000) has a contrast ratio of 4:1. The accessibility checker in Word would flag red text in a paragraph, but not in a heading that is 18pt or larger.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you will need to use a separate contrast checker. For example, the <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">WebAIM contrast checker</a> is a tool that allows you to choose the color of text and its background color by choosing the <strong>Color Picker</strong> option. This opens a dialog with an eyedropper icon. Choosing this icon will opens a tool for picking the color of a single pixel on the page.</p>

<h3>Use Larger Text, When Appropriate</h3>
<p>The contrast ratio for large text (text that is 18pt or larger, or 14pt or larger and bold) is 3:1 instead of 4.5:1. If certain colors that are part of your palette are too light to use as body or link text, these colors might be appropriate for large text like headings.</p>
<p>For example, a high school has school colors green and white. The shade of bright green that is used&mdash; #35A75B&mdash;has a contrast ratio of 3.07:1 when used on a white background and would not be appropriate as link text.</p>
<p><img id="1189412" class="img-responsive-320 centered" src="https://usucourses.instructure.com/courses/2803/files/1197409/preview" alt="Screenshot" width="320" height="156" data-api-endpoint="https://usucourses.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2803/files/1197409" data-api-returntype="File" /></p>
<p>But that shade of bright green could be used in headings instead.</p>
<p><img id="1189413" class="img-responsive-320 centered" src="https://usucourses.instructure.com/courses/2803/files/1197410/preview" alt="Screenshot" width="320" height="156" data-api-endpoint="https://usucourses.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2803/files/1197410" data-api-returntype="File" /></p>

<h3>Choose Legible Fonts and Simple Backgrounds</h3>
<p>Think beyond the minimum contrast requirements and choose easy-to-read fonts and simple backgrounds. A font that is very thin or a background that is busy will often make text harder to read. Solid background colors or subtle gradients are often best.</p>

<h2>Text Contrast Applied: Improved Contrast of Slides</h2>
<p>At Lincoln Elementary School, Mr. Ramirez, a 3rd grade teacher, noticed that one of his students, Jordan, often squinted at the screen during lessons and hesitated to participate in reading activities. Jordan, a bright and curious student with mild dyslexia, found it difficult to distinguish letters and words when they were displayed in low-contrast colors, such as gray text on a white background. Mr. Ramirez redesigned his digital materials using higher contrast text: white letters on a deep navy background.</p>
<p>The difference was immediate. Jordan began reading aloud more confidently and completing assignments faster. This adjustment in text contrast not only supported Jordan's learning but also created a more inclusive classroom where every student could engage with the material more effectively.</p>
