<p class="margin-top-50">Lists are a way to organize information to make information easier to read and understand. They can be bulleted (•) (also referred to as unordered lists) for items that don't need to be in a specific order, or numbered (1, 2, 3...) when the order matters.</p>
<div class="heading-group">

<h2>Why Accessible Lists Matter</h2>
<p>Creating accessible lists helps students quickly understand and remember key information. They break content into clear, manageable parts, which is especially helpful for learners with attention or processing challenges. When lists are created correctly with the bulleted or numbered list tools, screen readers will announce how many items are in lists and make it easy for students to navigate by each item in the list.</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<ol class="list-decimal">
<li>Explain how properly formatted lists help all students access and understand information more effectively.</li>
<li>Identify when to use bulleted vs. numbered lists to organize content for clarity and accessibility.</li>
<li>Apply best practices to create proper bulleted or numbered lists.</li>

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>
<section class="heading-section">
<h3>Use Built-in List Formatting Tools</h3>
<p>Avoid manually inserting symbols, dashes, spaces, or tabs to create lists. Use your content editor's list tools, such as the sample list icons pictured after this paragraph, to ensure consistent structure and accessibility. This ensures screen readers and other assistive technologies identify the list and announce the number of items, helping students navigate the content more effectively.</p>

<p>Listen to a screen reader announce a checklist as a user navigates between the list heading and each item in a manually created list that uses an empty box symbol as the bullet point.</p>

<p>Now listen again as the screen reader user navigates through the same list, this time formatted using the built-in bulleted list tool.</p>

<h3>Use Bullets for Lists and Numbers for Steps</h3>
<p>Use bullet points for items that don't follow a specific order such as materials, reminders, and classroom rules. Use numbered lists for instructions or processes that should be followed in sequence. This distinction helps students process the information and follow along more easily.</p>
<p><strong>Before you turn in your writing assignment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Did you include a clear introduction, body, and conclusion?</li>
<li>Did you check your spelling and grammar?</li>
<li>Did you follow the assignment instructions?</li>
<li>Did you add your name and the date?</li>
</ul>
<p>The instructions for submitting an assignment in Google Classroom should be included as a numbered list since the steps must be followed in order.</p>
<p><strong>Steps for Submitting a Student Writing Assignment in Google Classroom:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Google Classroom app or website.</li>
<li>Click on the correct class.</li>
<li>Select the assignment titled "Personal Narrative."</li>
<li>Attach your document or create a new one.</li>
<li>Click the "Turn in" button to submit.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Keep Each Item Short and Focused</h3>
<p>Aim to include one main idea per line. Long or combined points can be overwhelming and harder for students to follow, especially those with attention, reading, or processing challenges. Keeping items brief allows students to quickly scan the list, understand expectations, and take action without confusion.</p>
<p>Take the following bulleted list of combined classroom expectations for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Come to class on time and be prepared with all your materials.</li>
<li>Be respectful to teachers and classmates and take care of classroom materials.</li>
<li>Raise your hand before speaking and don't interrupt others while they are talking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since each bullet contains two or more distinct expectations, it would be more effective to break them apart into shorter list items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Come to class on time.</li>
<li>Bring all required materials.</li>
<li>Be respectful to teachers and classmates.</li>
<li>Take care of classroom materials.</li>
<li>Raise your hand before speaking.</li>
<li>Listen without interrupting others.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="heading-section">
<h3>Begin Each Item Consistently</h3>
<p>Start every list item with the same part of speech (e.g., verbs, nouns) to create a smooth, predictable reading pattern. This technique helps students quickly recognize the purpose of each item. Consistency also supports students who benefit from patterns and repetition, including students learning English and those with cognitive or language processing disabilities. You may have noticed how each item in the classroom expectations list above begins with a verb, creating a clear and consistent structure that emphasizes student actions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be</strong> respectful to teachers and classmates.</li>
<li><strong>Take</strong> care of classroom materials.</li>
<li><strong>Come</strong> to class on time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lists Applied: Successful Science Labs</h2>
<p>Ms. Nguyen, a 4th grade science teacher, noticed that some students were struggling with her lab instructions, so she began using lists in her Canvas course instructions. She used <strong>bulleted lists</strong> to outline materials that the students needed to gather at the start of each lab, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Safety goggles</li>
<li>Beakers</li>
<li>Thermometers</li>
<li>Lab notebooks</li>
</ul>
<p>She then used <strong>numbered lists</strong> to break down the lab procedures into clear, step-by-step instructions.</p>
<p>One student who benefitted significantly from this change was Aiden, who has ADHD. In the past, Aiden often forgot materials or skipped steps when instructions were buried in paragraphs. With the new format, he could check off materials as he collected them and follow each step in order.</p>
