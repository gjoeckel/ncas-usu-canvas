<h2>Why Alternative Text Matters</h2>
<p>Images are often used to show important information in web pages, documents and presentations. However, not everyone can perceive visual information from images. Adding alt text to describe the purpose of your image is essential to ensuring all students can access the same content. When alternative text is available for an image, assistive technology devices like screen readers or refreshable braille displays can access that written content and read it in place of the image.</p>

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>
</section>
<section class="heading-section">
<h3>Focus on the Image's Purpose</h3>
<p>Write alt text based on what the image is meant to convey in the instructional context where it is being used. Think about what the student should understand or experience from the image. Consider different contexts for the following image:</p>
<p><img id="1185329" class="img-responsive-320 centered" src="https://usucourses.instructure.com/courses/2803/files/1197401/preview" alt="Green frog resting on a leaf" width="320" height="213" data-api-endpoint="https://usucourses.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2803/files/1197401" data-api-returntype="File" /></p>
<p class="text-center"><a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/tree-frog-resting-on-green-leaf-2170198/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source</a></p>
<p>In a 3<sup>rd</sup> grade science lesson on the life cycle the alt text might be,</p>
<p class="text-center">&ldquo;Adult frog resting on a leaf during the final stage of metamorphosis&rdquo;</p>
<p>While that exact same image used as a prompt for an 8<sup>th</sup> grade creative writing course might have the following alt text:</p>
<p class="text-center">&ldquo;Sleepy green frog dreaming of new adventures&rdquo;</p>
</section>
<section class="heading-section">
<h3>Be Simple and Precise</h3>
<p>Use clear, concise language to describe the image. Remember that everything you write will be read aloud for some users. Avoid overcomplicating the description or adding unnecessary details. As an example, let&rsquo;s look at the following image used in an assignment about space satellites:</p>
<p><img id="1185331" class="img-responsive-400 centered" src="https://usucourses.instructure.com/courses/2803/files/1197404/preview" alt="Photo of the planet earth from space" width="400" height="400" data-api-endpoint="https://usucourses.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2803/files/1197404" data-api-returntype="File" /></p>
<p class="text-center"><a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/planet-earth-87651/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source</a></p>
<p>An educator may want to make sure that all students have all the detail from this image and in their attempts to be helpful add extra, unnecessary information in the alt text:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A photograph taken from space showing a view of the western hemisphere of planet earth that features North America in the center. Central America is also visible, as well as the upper part of South America. A vast blue ocean dominates the planet and swirling cloud formations cover most of the land and ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead, the following brief alt text would be more appropriate for the image in most cases:</p>
<p class="text-center">&ldquo;Photo of planet earth from space&rdquo;</p>
</section>
<section class="heading-section">
<h3>Mark Images as Decorative When Appropriate</h3>
<p>If the image does not present important information, mark it as decorative to let assistive technologies know that it can skip over that image. For example, the following image of colored pencils at the top of a welcome to class page is purely decorative and doesn&rsquo;t provide any meaningful information. It should be marked decorative so it will be skipped for assistive technology users.</p>
<p><img id="1185330" class="img-responsive-400 centered" src="https://usucourses.instructure.com/courses/2803/files/1197403/preview" alt="Photo of colored pencils that would be marked as decorative in most contexts." width="400" height="253" data-api-endpoint="https://usucourses.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2803/files/1197403" data-api-returntype="File" /></p>

</section>
<section class="heading-section">
<h3>Include Important Text</h3>
<p>If the image includes important text, be sure to also include that text in the alt text so that it is available to all users. For example, an educator is hoping to encourage his students and posted the following image to his online course:</p>
<p><img id="1185333" class="img-responsive-320 centered" src="https://usucourses.instructure.com/courses/2803/files/1197406/preview" alt="Sign with text that reads: Make this day great!" width="320" height="206" data-api-endpoint="https://usucourses.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2803/files/1197406" data-api-returntype="File" /></p>
<p class="text-center"><a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/illuminated-qoute-board-2255441/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source</a></p>
<p>The alt text for the image should include the same text from the image:</p>
<p class="text-center">&ldquo;Make this day great!&rdquo;</p>
</section>
<section class="heading-section">
<h3>Skip &ldquo;Image of&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Avoid starting alt text with phrases like &ldquo;image of&rdquo; or &ldquo;picture of.&rdquo; Assistive technologies like screen readers already recognize images and can communicate that as needed to users so there is no need to add that extra, unnecessary information. Listen to a screen reader announce the graphic above and its alt text.</p>

<h2>Alternative Text Applied: Adding Alternative Text to a Study Guide</h2>
<p>Mr. Christensen teaches 11th grade AP Physics and is preparing a study guide for an upcoming quiz on Kinetic energy. He is planning on using the following image in a Word document to help students understand the concept:</p>
<p><img id="1185328" class="img-responsive-400 centered" src="https://usucourses.instructure.com/courses/2803/files/1197407/preview" alt="Illustration of a roller coaster" width="400" height="216" data-api-endpoint="https://usucourses.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2803/files/1197407" data-api-returntype="File" /></p>
<p>When creating the document, he remembers Amira in his second hour course who is blind and uses a screen reader to read her digital documents. He wants to make sure that she has access to the same material and remembers there is a way to add alt text to images in Microsoft Word. He selects the image, opens the Picture Format menu, selects Alt Text, and writes the following description:</p>
<p class="text-center">&ldquo;Illustration of a roller coaster train of cars descending a steep hill, demonstrating energy conversion as it gains speed downhill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Amira reviews the study guide, her screen reader recognizes there is alt text for the image and reads it aloud. The alt text confirms her understanding of the concept, and she aces the quiz!</p>
